			<h1 className="p-1">About Me</h1>
			<p className="p-1">I am a skilled and passionate machine learning engineer with a Master's degree in Scientific Computing and Applied Mathematics from UCSC, where I received the SciCAM Master's Program and Next Gen. SAM Scholar honors. My domain expertise lies in natural language processing and computer vision, and I have a strong interest in data mining, generative AI, and large language models.</p>

			<p className="p-1">In my most recent role, I was a Team Athena Member at UCSC, where I collaborated with my peers to build a conversational AI system that can generate accurate and contextually relevant responses, leveraging pre-trained language models and AWS services. I also integrated computer vision techniques to enable aerial vision-and-dialog navigation for drones, using a photorealistic simulator and a novel dataset that I helped collect. These projects resulted in multiple publications, a $50,000 award, and significant improvements in project efficiencies and user ratings. Additionally, I have been involved in research projects on building a website for research paper filtering and building dynamical models to distinguish the drosophila genes. I have also served as a graduate teaching assistant for several courses on mathematical methods, calculus, and high-performance computing.</p>

			<p className="p-1">I am committed to contributing my skills and knowledge to make meaningful advancements in the fields of computer science and machine learning. I am always eager to learn new technologies and methods, and to apply them to real-world problems. I value teamwork, innovation, and diversity, and I strive to deliver high-quality and impactful solutions.</p>
